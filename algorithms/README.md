## List of algorithms to cover:

**Sorting Algorithms**

1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Shell Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Heap Sort
7. Quick Sort
8. Counting Sort

**Searching Algorithm**

9. Breadth First Search
10. Depth First Search
11. Binary Search
12. Recursion

Directions - Make a .js file for each algorithm, implement them, and use this template to do so:

**Template for each .js file** 

```

// Solution for challenge.

// Solution should have a comment for each method.

// Notes to yourself. How would you explain the code

// Save as a Javascript file.

```

**Note**: Get very familiar with this site. Google any topics from the site and if needed, but try to be comfortable with the site. It has a big reference for most algorithms and data structures. Remember: You don't have to know the language syntax (C++, Python and Java), pay attention to patterns and reimplement the code in Javascript.

Posting this here again for switching the code on the site to Javascript:

**How to translate the code from the textbooks to Javascript.**

> Solve the problems in your own language (pseudocode).
> Give yourselves around twenty minutes to solve the problem.
> Look up the solutions in Javascript version on Google.
> Once you find a solution, understand it.
> Move on to the next question.
