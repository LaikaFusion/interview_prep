### Career Prep

You should have:

1. Writing your resume in Markdown `.md` or just adding the `.pdf` or any other file here. It does not need a folder but feel free to add one.


2. Info sheets 

> Make up to 20 info files for dream companies. You can add more.

> Make files for companies who will interview you - number of files depends on how many companies called you.

3. Put cover letters in a folder.
