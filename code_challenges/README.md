## All code challenges come here. 

I made a small post I follow when I practice my coding challenges. It's been helping so far but feel free to work with your own techniques. Coming up with methods of your own makes things more interesting.

*Current approach for practicing coding challenges*:

1. Always understand the problem first.
2. List tasks the challenge wants you to complete.
3. Quick brainstorm --> How do I complete each task?
4. Handwrite different approaches to the problem on a mini whiteboard or notebook in your language (pseudocode).
5. Test each approach typing code.
6. Did you solve it? Great. Next question.

Didn't solve it after 20 min? Search. (Google, Stack Overflow, Youtube)
7. Understand the solution you find. Break it up, test each part.
8. Look up coding methods on documentation.
9. Code the given solution on it's own, and comment what each part of the solution code is doing.
10. Code the solution again your own way.
11. Understand it? Cool. Next question.

*Notes*
> Practice coding in front of people. We will cover that in standups.
> Do mock interviews weekly. You can do this biweekly with any friend or mentor.
> Use a timer for the 20 minute mark.
