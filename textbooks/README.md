## Textbooks to look over during your progress.

**Tips**

- It's easy to download twenty books online and call it a day, but it's more important to read one front to back and use it as a guide.

- Choose up to three books. I picked two that are very important in Software Engineering. `Cracking the Code Interview` is the go to book for every Computer Science student. `Grokkings Algorithms` is well known for being a lot more easy to read.

- You will notice that each book is written in different languages. `Cracking the Code Interview` works with Java and `Grokkings Algorithm` works with Python. 

- Don't attempt to learn the language syntax before reading the books (e.g. teaching yourself Python because `Grokking Algorithms` teaches in Python). Each language may be different in some ways but are similar in others. Learn the patterns in each language. You will start to see some similarities. 

**How to translate the code from the textbooks to Javascript.**

1. Solve the problems in your own language (pseudocode).
2. Give yourselves around twenty minutes to solve the problem. 3. Look up the solutions in Javascript version on Google.
4. Once you find a solution, understand it.
5. Move on to the next question.
